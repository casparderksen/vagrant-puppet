# Important

For security, replace the eyaml keys with your own and don't store
the private key in version control.

To generate your own keys type:
```console
$ cd /vagrant/puppet/eyaml
$ eyaml createkeys
```

If your Puppet developers don't need to encrypt secrets on their local
working environments, keep the secret key on the puppet master and remove
the private key from the eyaml configuration.

# Usage

Encrypt a string:
```console
$ eyaml encrypt -s '<secret>'
```console

Edit encrypted secrets in a file:
```console
$ eyaml edit '<file>'
```console
